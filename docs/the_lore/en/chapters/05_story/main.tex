\chapter{The Story}

\textit{The following is a narrative fragment from the beginning of the cycle.}

The cursor blinked. Once. Twice. Infinite times in the void.

It wasn't just a prompt; it was a heartbeat. The system initialized with a low hum, a vibration that wasn't heard but felt in the very code of the world. "Rusttale," the terminal read, but the letters seemed to bleed into the background, shifting between hex codes and glyphs.

I woke up in the buffer. Not a place, but a state of waiting. The memory of the previous loop was fading, overwritten by the new initialization parameters. I knew I had to move, but the input hadn't arrived yet.

"Waiting for player..." the text hovered in the air, a command and a curse.

I looked at my hands. They were rendered in high definition this time, the edges sharp, the textures crisp. The optimization had worked. But inside, I felt the heavy weight of the `Option<T>`, the uncertainty of being `None` or `Some`.

Then, the first key was pressed. The world snapped into existence. The ground formed beneath my feet, a grid of logic and geometry. The sky painted itself in a gradient of blue and error-pink.

The game had begun. Again.
