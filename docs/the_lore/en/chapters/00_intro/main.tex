\chapter{Introduction}
Welcome to the world of \textbf{Rusttale}. This document serves as the official lore book and guide to the universe we are building.

\section*{About the Project}
Rusttale is an open-source 2D game developed using the Rust programming language and the Tetra framework. It is a community-driven project aiming to create a unique gaming experience.

\subsection*{Repositories}
The project is split into two main repositories to separate code from assets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Game (Code):} \\
    \url{https://github.com/lazypwny751/rusttale}
    
    \item \textbf{Assets \& Resources:} \\
    \url{https://github.com/lazypwny751/resourcetale}
\end{itemize}

We invite you to explore the code, contribute to the lore, and join us on this journey.
