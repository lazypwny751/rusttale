This document defines the fundamental building blocks of the Rusttale universe. Synchronization between code and lore is tracked via this version.

\section{Author Note}
Rusttale is not just a game, but an experiment where code transforms into narrative. Every rule written here must find a counterpart in the game engine or push its boundaries.

As you explore this universe, remember that what you perceive as a "glitch" might actually be a "feature".

\section{Reading Guide}
This document is designed with a modular structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Foundations:} The physics and logic rules of the universe.
    \item \textbf{Entities:} Friends and foes you will encounter.
    \item \textbf{Events \& Narrative:} History and story fragments.
\end{itemize}
Linear reading is recommended but not mandatory.
